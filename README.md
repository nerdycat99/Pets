## Pets 2U - Pet Store

The PetStore module's order method takes an array of animals as it's one argument.
Animals must be provided by their first letter (case insensitive), i.e. PetStore.order(['M','S']).

The module will determine the optimum (lowest) number of boxes required to complete the order
and will warn if an animal does not exist or there is no box to fit an animal that can be ordered.

NB: user beware, the module will not tell you whether animals packed into the same box might like
to eat each other enroute!!!
